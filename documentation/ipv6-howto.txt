Start using IPv6:
  caget, camonitor can work via IPV6 like this:
  $ export EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
  $ export EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST='[2001:db8:1:0:0:1:2:3]'
  cainfo IOC:m1

  Using link local addresses:
    Find out the link-local address of your IOC.
    e.g. fe80::3958:418:65b8:230c
    Find out the interface of your client, sitting on the same network
    switch as the IOC.
    $ ifconfig
    # or
    $ ip addr show
    in my case it is "en0"
    # ping the IOC:
    $ ping6 fe80::3958:418:65b8:230c
      ping6: sendmsg: No route to host
    # That didn't work, we new this.
    # Compose a proper adress, combining the remote IPv6 with
    # our local interface name:
    $ ping6 fe80::3958:418:65b8:230c%en0
    16 bytes from fe80::3958:418:65b8:230c%en0
    # with this knowledge, we can use cainfo:
    $ export EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
    $ export EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST='[fe80::3958:418:65b8:230c%en0]'
    $ cainfo IOC:m1


  Running an IOC on a Mac:
    When using a "wireless only", there are different IPv6 interfaces.
    The wireless itself :"en0",
    An interface called "en3" (not sure what this is good for)
    "awdl0" "llw0" (and some "utun0" and "utun1")
    It seems as if our code does not handle this situation correctly (yet).
    In order to use the wireless:
    $  export EPICS_CAS_BEACON_ADDR_LIST='[ff02::1%en0]'
    This will put out beacons on all IPv4 addresses.
    IPv6 beacons are send out on en0.

  Running an IOC on Linux:
    $  export EPICS_CAS_AUTO_BEACON_ADDR_LIST=46
    This sends out beacons on all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces


Windows (Mingw)
  While Windows as such supports IPv6, the current code does not work here:
    epicsSocketCreate(../udpiiu.cpp:172) (AF_INET6) socket=512
    CAC: failed to set mcast loopback sock=512
    CAC: failed to set mcast ttl 1 sock=512
    ../udpiiu.cpp:261: bind(512) address='[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0%0]:0' socklenIn=28 socklenOut=28 status=0:
    ../iocinf.cpp/240: EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST='YES' addrautolistIPversion=4
    ../iocinf.cpp/268: calling osiSockDiscoverBroadcastAddresses: sock=512 match46='0.0.0.0:0'
    WSAIoctl SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST failed 10022

  More investigations are needed.
  Which version of Windows do we want to support ?
  XP ? Vista ? Windows 10 ?
