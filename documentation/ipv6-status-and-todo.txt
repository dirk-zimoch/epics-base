Status and to do of EPICS base:

- Channel Access:
   - Cannel name resolution:
     working: using link-local IPv6 addresses or global IPv6 addresses.
     todo: test with a DNS name (AAAA record)
   - beacons:
     Are send out via IPv6 link local addresses if configured
     with EPICS_CAS_AUTO_BEACON_ADDR_LIST=6 (or 46)
     The beacons use an extended message for CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP
   - Revers name resolution
     aToIPAddr does not handle IPv6 (and needs to be replace)
     Some problems to convert interface index into a name
     (The #%en0" part of the IPv6 address)
     Needs to be investigated (may be not thread-save ?)
   - Channel access via TCP/IPv6
     working
   - repeater
     Handles only registrations via IPv4
     Does forward beacons with the extended "CA_PROTO_RSRV_IS_UP" format

- pvAccess:
   Nothing done yet.
   Probably we can steal/reuse code from channel access.
   However, I would kike to see channel acces more tested before starting
   with pvAccess

- Linux, MacOs, Windows, vxWorks, RTEMS, BSD
  Testing on Linux and Mac looks good. Need to re-run FreeBSD.
  Windows: (Which "Windows" ? Visual Studio ? cygwin (seems obsolete) Mingw
  vxWorks, RTEMS: Testing needed.

- pyepics (with the latest ca library)
  First tests look good ("PYEPICS_LIBCA" is your friend)

- pvapy: to be done
- JCA: to be done
- EPICS gateways: to be done
- asyn: I had done a working prototype. Need to dig out the source code.

Other planned todo (unorderedd)
- Clean up the debug printing
- Clean up the compiler flag EPICS_HAS_IPV6 (suggested by Michael)
- More code review
- write automated tests
